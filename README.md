## Description 
This repository contains the UI/UX redesign of a  digital agency website called **Tween Agency** ,designed using **Figma** as part of my internship at CodTech IT Solutions.
I recently designed the homepage and About section of a website for a fictional tween-focused creative agency using Figma. The goal was to create a visually engaging and user-friendly design that resonates with tweens—youths between the ages of 8 and 12—and their parents, while also highlighting the agency's creative services and values.

The website opens with a bold, vibrant hero section that immediately grabs attention. I used a bright and playful color palette paired with dynamic typography to reflect the energy, curiosity, and creativity of tweens. The hero includes a catchy tagline, a short introductory message, and a strong call-to-action button that invites visitors to learn more about the agency. I ensured that the design feels modern yet age-appropriate, using playful design elements like geometric shapes, abstract doodles, and animated accents to maintain a fun yet professional look.

Navigation is kept simple and intuitive with a sticky top navbar containing links to key sections: Home, About, Services, Projects, and Contact. This helps guide the user journey, whether it's a tween exploring or a parent looking for trustworthy creative partners for their child.

Moving into the About section, I focused on storytelling and connection. The section starts with a bold headline and a short mission statement that outlines the agency's purpose—empowering young minds through design, technology, and creativity. This is followed by a short paragraph elaborating on how the agency helps tweens turn their ideas into reality through workshops, mentorship, and digital services like content creation, branding, and UI/UX design.

To add warmth and trust, I included a section with illustrated team member avatars, brief bios, and roles. This helps put a face to the agency and assures parents that their children are in the hands of friendly, creative professionals. There’s also a short testimonial block showcasing positive feedback from previous clients, building credibility and trust.

Responsiveness was a key focus during the design process. The layout adapts smoothly to both desktop and mobile screens, ensuring usability across devices. I used Figma's Auto Layout and Constraints to keep elements aligned and proportionate, maintaining the integrity of the design across screen sizes.

Throughout the design, I paid close attention to accessibility by choosing high-contrast text, legible fonts, and clear visual hierarchy. Icons and illustrations were selected to match the branding tone—fun, expressive, and empowering—while maintaining clarity and consistency.

In summary, this website design sets the tone for a vibrant, tween-centered agency that stands out in the digital space. The design is not only aesthetically appealing but also functional, with clear communication and thoughtful layout. I’m excited to continue building out the remaining pages, further enhancing the site’s interactivity and storytelling while keeping the target audience—tweens and their guardians—at the heart of the experience.
